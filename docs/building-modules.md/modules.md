## Role of Modules in an SDK Application

The Cosmos SDK can be thought as the Ruby-on-Rails of blockchain development. It comes with a core that provides the basic functionalities every blockchain application need, like a boilerplate implementation of the ABCI to communicate with the underlying consensus engine, a multistore to persist state, a server to form a full-node and interfaces to handle queries.
